## The makeCacheMatrix function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its 
## inverse, while cacheSolve computes the inverse of that special "matrix".

## MakeCacheMatrix initializes x (the function argument) and m (used within the 
## function environment).  After initializing the objects, setters and getters 
## are defined for x and m.  List is used to send the functions to the parent 
## environment.
